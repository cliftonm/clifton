<p>Service Manager - Instantiation by Interface Specification</p>
<p>A Clifton Method Core Component - Part II</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/cliftonm/clifton">Complete source code, including 
the demo here</a></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This article builds on what I call &quot;The Clifton Method&quot; of software 
development.&nbsp; The first article in this series is The Module Manager, and 
while this code in this article stands on its own, it is ultimately intended to 
work in conjunction with the Module Manager.</p>
<p>The concept of instantiating concrete instances via an interface 
specification should be a well known pattern of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle">
dependency inversion principle</a>.&nbsp; As that Wikipedia link summarizes:</p>
<p><i>In object-oriented programming, the dependency inversion principle refers 
to a specific form of decoupling software modules. When following this 
principle, the conventional dependency relationships established from 
high-level, policy-setting modules to low-level, dependency modules are 
reversed, thus rendering high-level modules independent of the low-level module 
implementation details. The principle states:</i></p>
<ul>
	<li><i>High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both 
	should depend on abstractions.</i></li>
	<li><i>Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on 
	abstractions.</i></li>
</ul>
<h3>What Problem Does DIP Solve?</h3>
<p>Similar to the Module Manager, the Service Manager provides the ability to 
decouple dependencies between objects.&nbsp; An &quot;dependency entangled&quot; 
application instantiates classes directly.&nbsp; One can come up with many 
examples of dependency entanglement:</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="depentangled.png" width="372" height="270"></p>
<p>In these situations, the dependency between the high level component and the 
low level component is hard-wired in the implementation.&nbsp; Should the 
requirements change, the code requires considerable rework to either replace or 
abstract out the low level dependencies.&nbsp; The problem gets more complicated 
when the low level components themselves interface to higher level components, 
for example, when user interface events, handled by a controller, require 
database I/O that can affect the user interface:</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="depentangled2.png" width="372" height="240"></p>
<p>The Dependency Inversion Principle decouples the dependencies such that <i>
both</i> high level and low level components can be changed without breaking the
<i>code</i>.&nbsp; This results in an implementation that looks a bit more like 
this:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="dip1.png" width="624" height="747"></p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="key-small.jpg" width="94" height="33"></p>
<p align="left">In this diagram, both high and low level components have been 
abstracted such that the application (not shown) can be implemented using 
interfaces, rather than concrete classes, achieving a high level of decoupling 
between &quot;what the application wants to do&quot; vs. &quot;how the component does it.&quot;</p>
<h3>Is The Extra Work Worth It?</h3>
<p>The above diagram illustrates that more work (sometimes considerably more 
work) is required on the part of the programmer to create the interfaces, 
specify the interface behaviors, and in many cases, write wrappers that 
implement the interface behaviors.&nbsp; For example, a more accurate picture of 
the UI abstraction might look like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="dip2.png" width="829" height="227"></p>
<p>The balance the <i>architect</i> (not the developer, unless they are the same 
person) must achieve between entanglement and abstraction is often determined by 
questions like:</p>
<ul>
	<li>What components am I confident that I know I'm going to stick with?</li>
	<li>What components will need to vary in concrete implementation, and not 
	just as determined by the current requirements but by unforeseen future 
	changes?</li>
</ul>
<p><img border="0" src="sad%20smiley.png" width="32" height="32"> Unfortunately, 
the answers to both questions often requires a crystal ball!</p>
<p><img border="0" src="smiley.png" width="32" height="32"> That said, when a 
happy medium is determined, the resulting application is more robust and 
amenable to change, typically resulting in a longer lifetime, and future changes 
are less costly to implement.&nbsp; One of the immediate uses of this approach 
is that services can be easily mocked, which facilitates unit testing and 
application development when either the service hasn't yet been implemented or, 
for example, is associated with hardware that you may not have available.</p>
<h2>The Service Manager</h2>
<p>The Service Manager is a lightweight implementation of the Dependency 
Inversion Principle.&nbsp; In a nutshell, components, whether high or low level, 
are instantiated by associating the concrete implementation with an interface.&nbsp; 
</p>
<h3>Singleton Instantiation</h3>
<p>Here's a minimal example:</p>
<pre>using System;

using Clifton.Core.ServiceManagement;

namespace ServiceManagerDemo
{
  public interface IAnimal : IService
  {
    void Speak();
  }

  public interface ICat : IAnimal { }
  public interface IDog : IAnimal { }

  public class Cat : ServiceBase, ICat
  {
    public void Speak()
    {
      Console.WriteLine(&quot;Meow&quot;);
    }
  }

  public class Dog : ServiceBase, IDog
  {
    public void Speak()
    {
      Console.WriteLine(&quot;Woof&quot;);
    }
  }

  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      ServiceManager svcMgr = new ServiceManager();
      svcMgr.RegisterSingleton&lt;ICat, Cat&gt;();
      svcMgr.RegisterSingleton&lt;IDog, Dog&gt;();
      IAnimal animal1 = svcMgr.Get&lt;ICat&gt;();
      IAnimal animal2 = svcMgr.Get&lt;IDog&gt;();
      animal1.Speak();
      animal2.Speak();
    }
  }
}</pre>
<p><img border="0" src="output1.png" width="284" height="133"></p>
<p>In this example, observe how:</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>IAnimal</code> is the effectively the pure abstract 
specification for anything that derives from it.&nbsp; </li>
	<li>The &quot;concrete&quot; interfaces, <code>ICat</code> and <code>IDog</code>, are derived from 
	<code>IAnimal</code> but do not 
contain any specific implementation.</li>
	<li>The concrete implementation of <code>Cat</code> and <code>Dog</code> derives from 
	<code>ICat</code> and <code>IDog</code>, 
respectively, and implements the <code>IAnimal</code> behavior.</li>
	<li>In this example, we tell the Service Manager that the &quot;services&quot; <code>Cat</code> and 
	<code>Dog</code> are singletons--they are instantiated only once and subsequent Get calls 
	return the one and only instance.</li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="catadog1.png" width="372" height="286"></p>
<p align="left">The interface <code>IService</code> and the abstract class <code>ServiceBase</code> are 
provided by the Service Manager will be discussed later.</p>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="important.png" width="38" height="32"> What's 
interesting about this architecture is that the interfaces themselves are 
abstracted:</p>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p align="left">A common interface <code>IAnimal</code> describes the behavior of the 
	abstracted concept.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Empty child interfaces deriving from <code>IAnimal</code> provide the 
	means for mapping the &quot;concrete&quot; interface with a &quot;concrete&quot; implementor, 
	thus determining which &quot;animal&quot; is to be instantiated.</p></li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Typically, &quot;concrete&quot; interfaces do not have further 
	behavior specification, though there may be reasons why this is useful / 
	necessary.</p></li>
</ol>
<p align="left"><img border="0" src="Note.png" width="24" height="32"> When 
registering a singleton, it is actually instantiated immediately by the service 
manager.&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Non-Singleton Instantiation</h3>
<p>Services are often singletons, but one can instantiate more than one instance 
of a service as well.&nbsp; In this example, we'll look at created multiple 
instances of <code>Cat</code>:</p>
<pre>using System;

using Clifton.Core.ServiceManagement;

namespace ServiceManagerInstanceDemo
{
  public interface IAnimal : IService
  {
    string Name { get; set; }
    void Speak();
  }

  public interface ICat : IAnimal { }

  public abstract class Animal : ServiceBase
  {
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public abstract void Speak();
  }

  public class Cat : Animal, ICat
  {
    public override void Speak()
    {
      Console.WriteLine(Name + &quot; says 'Meow'&quot;);
    }
  }

  public static class InstanceDemo
  {
    public static void Demo()
    {
      ServiceManager svcMgr = new ServiceManager();
      svcMgr.RegisterInstanceOnly&lt;ICat, Cat&gt;();
      IAnimal cat1 = svcMgr.Get&lt;ICat&gt;();
      cat1.Name = &quot;Fido&quot;;
      IAnimal cat2 = svcMgr.Get&lt;ICat&gt;();
      cat2.Name = &quot;Morris&quot;;
      cat1.Speak();
      cat2.Speak();
    }
  }
}</pre>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="dip3.png" width="372" height="346"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="output2.png" width="312" height="147"></p>
<p>Notice how:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The service is registered with <code>RegisterInstanceOnly</code> instead of 
	<code>RegisterSingleton</code>.&nbsp; </li>
	<li>An abstract class implements the Name property but specifies that <code>Speak</code> 
	is still abstract, as the Name property is common to all animals now.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can also specify a function in the <code>Get</code> method to assign values to 
properties as part of the <code>Get</code> call, for example:</p>
<pre>IAnimal cat2 = svcMgr.Get&lt;ICat&gt;(cat =&gt; cat.Name = &quot;Morris&quot;);</pre>
<h3>Exclusive Services</h3>
<p>Frequently a service is exclusive of all other implementers.&nbsp; The application may, for example, require only one database 
service.&nbsp; Different installations may require connecting to a different 
database, but the scenario where the application connects to <i>two different</i> 
database services at the same time doesn't occur.&nbsp; This creates a simpler scenario for 
the interface implementation -- in the examples that I've been using, the 
&quot;Animal&quot; service, if viewed as an exclusive service, is implemented either by 
<code>Cat</code> or <code>Dog</code>, and we never need to implement both simultaneously:</p>
<pre>using System;

using Clifton.Core.ServiceManagement;

namespace ServiceManagerExclusiveDemo
{
  public interface IAnimal : IService
  {
    void Speak();
  }

  public class Cat : ServiceBase, IAnimal
  {
    public void Speak()
    {
      Console.WriteLine(&quot;Meow&quot;);
    }
  }

  public static class ExclusiveDemo
  {
    public static void Demo()
    {
      ServiceManager svcMgr = new ServiceManager();
      svcMgr.RegisterSingleton&lt;IAnimal, Cat&gt;();
      IAnimal animal = svcMgr.Get&lt;IAnimal&gt;();
      animal.Speak();
    }
  }
}</pre>
<p>As the above code illustrates, the implementation is simpler.&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Getting a Service Determined at Runtime </h3>
<p>The Service Manager is not a dependency injection framework (DIF) -- you will note that the singleton and instance examples above, the code still 
needs to reference the concrete interface that maps to the concrete implementation:</p>
<pre>      IAnimal animal1 = svcMgr.Get&lt;ICat&gt;();
      IAnimal animal2 = svcMgr.Get&lt;IDog&gt;();</pre>
<p>Here, the code is still 
specifying the concrete interface.&nbsp; Typically you will want to 
instantiate the class from the concrete interface, but there are may be 
situations in which the concrete interface is not known at compile time, instead 
it is determined at runtime.&nbsp; This can be handled by a DIF which injects 
the concrete instance into a property at runtime, but in my 
opinion, that adds a lot of unnecessary kruft.</p>
<p>This problem can be solved by specifying the type, not as a generic 
parameter, but rather as an actual <code>Type</code> parameter that you acquire from somewhere 
else (configuration file, etc).&nbsp; Here's a rather simplified example in which we first assume some 
process is mapping concrete interfaces with concrete implementers.</p>
<pre>public static void RegisterServices()
{
  svcMgr = new ServiceManager();
  svcMgr.RegisterSingleton&lt;ICat, Cat&gt;();
  svcMgr.RegisterSingleton&lt;IDog, Dog&gt;();
}</pre>
<p>Let's say we want to call an operation that is going to use the <code>IAnimal</code> 
service, but it doesn't know what concrete interface to use.&nbsp; We have two 
options.&nbsp; We can make the call like this (here <code>IDog</code> and <code>ICat</code> are 
implemented in my demo namespace):</p>
<pre>ByTypeDemo.ByTypeParameter(typeof(ServiceManagerByTypeDemo.ICat));
ByTypeDemo.ByTypeParameter(typeof(ServiceManagerByTypeDemo.IDog));</pre>
<p>and implement the method like this (please note that the use of <code>static</code> is 
only for the convenience of the demo):</p>
<pre>public static void ByTypeParameter(Type someAnimal)
{
  IAnimal animal = svcMgr.Get&lt;IAnimal&gt;(someAnimal);
  animal.Speak();
}
</pre>
<p>This however has the disadvantage of losing type consistency -- we know 
longer guarantee that <code>someAnimal</code> implements <code>IAnimal</code>, which means that if it 
doesn't, we'll get a runtime error.</p>
<p>A better call and implementation would look like this:</p>
<pre>public static void ByGenericParameter&lt;T&gt;() where T : IAnimal
{
  IAnimal animal = svcMgr.Get&lt;T&gt;();
  animal.Speak();
}
</pre>
<p>The second approach is much better because it enforces at compile time the 
type of the generic parameter.&nbsp; The implementer needs to only know the 
generic interface <code>IAnimal</code>, not the concrete interfaces <code>ICat</code> and <code>IDog</code>, 
but none-the-less, it is guaranteed that the generic parameter is of type 
<code>IAnimal</code>.</p>
<h2>Implementation Details</h2>
<p><img border="0" src="note.png" width="24" height="32"> The Service Manager is itself implemented as a service:</p>
<pre>public class ServiceManager : ServiceBase, IServiceManager</pre>
<p>This means that, in conjunction with the Module Manager, the Service Manager 
can be loaded as a service, and that the service provided by the Service Manager 
is itself abstracted and replaceable (as long as you implement <code>IServiceManager</code>!)</p>
<h3>Thread Safety</h3>
<p>The Service Manager is intended to be thread safe, so the three pieces of 
information that it manages use <code>ConcurrentDictionary</code>:</p>
<pre>protected ConcurrentDictionary&lt;Type, Type&gt; interfaceServiceMap;
protected ConcurrentDictionary&lt;Type, IService&gt; singletons;
protected ConcurrentDictionary&lt;Type, ConstructionOption&gt; constructionOption;</pre>
<p>The only time a lock is required is when creating or returning a previously 
created singleton -- we need the lock here to prevent two threads from 
simultaneously either attempting to create a singleton, or one thread creating 
the singleton while another thread is attempted to acquire the singleton:</p>
<pre>/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Return a registered singleton or create it and register it if it isn't registered.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
protected IService CreateOrGetSingleton&lt;T&gt;(Action&lt;T&gt; initializer)
where T : IService
{
  Type t = typeof(T);
  IService instance;

  lock (locker)
  {
    if (!singletons.TryGetValue(t, out instance))
    {
      instance = CreateAndRegisterSingleton&lt;T&gt;(initializer);
    }
  }

  return instance;
}</pre>
<h3>Instance Registration</h3>
<p>Instance registration involves adding an entry to the interface service map 
and preserving the fact that the type is intended to be an instance:</p>
<pre>public virtual void RegisterInstanceOnly&lt;I, S&gt;()
where I : IService
where S : IService
{
  Type interfaceType = typeof(I);
  Type serviceType = typeof(S);
  Assert.Not(interfaceServiceMap.ContainsKey(interfaceType), &quot;The service &quot; + GetName&lt;S&gt;() + &quot; has already been registered.&quot;);
  interfaceServiceMap[interfaceType] = serviceType;
  constructionOption[interfaceType] = ConstructionOption.AlwaysInstance;
}</pre>
<h3>Singleton Registration</h3>
<p>Singleton registration involves adding an entry to the interface service map 
and instantiating the singleton:</p>
<pre>public virtual void RegisterSingleton&lt;I, S&gt;(Action&lt;I&gt; initializer = null)
where I : IService
where S : IService
{
  Type interfaceType = typeof(I);
  Type serviceType = typeof(S);
  Assert.Not(interfaceServiceMap.ContainsKey(interfaceType), &quot;The service &quot; + GetName&lt;S&gt;() + &quot; has already been registered.&quot;);
  interfaceServiceMap[interfaceType] = serviceType;
  constructionOption[interfaceType] = ConstructionOption.AlwaysSingleton;
  RegisterSingletonBaseInterfaces(interfaceType, serviceType);

  // Singletons are always instantiated immediately so that they can be initialized
  // for global behaviors. A good example is the global exception handler services.
  CreateAndRegisterSingleton&lt;I&gt;(initializer);
}</pre>
<h3>Creation and Registration</h3>
<p>For both singletons and instance services, the instance, when created, is 
created, registered, and an initialization method is called (discussed below):</p>
<pre>protected virtual IService CreateAndRegisterSingleton&lt;T&gt;(Action&lt;T&gt; initializer = null)
  where T : IService
{
  IService instance = CreateInstance&lt;T&gt;(initializer);
  Register&lt;T&gt;(instance);
  instance.Initialize(this);

  return instance;
}

protected IService CreateInstance&lt;T&gt;(Action&lt;T&gt; initializer)
where T : IService
{
  Type t = typeof(T);
  IService instance = (IService)Activator.CreateInstance(interfaceServiceMap[t]);
  initializer.IfNotNull((i) =&gt; i((T)instance));

  return instance;
}</pre>
<p>If we were using C# 6.0, we 
could replace the <code>IfNotNull</code> extension method with:</p>
<pre>initializer?.((T)instance));</pre>
<p>but I haven't upgraded the code base to C# 6.0 yet!</p>
<h3>Getting the Service Instance</h3>
<p>When we request a service, the Service Manager checks whether we want, based 
on the registration, a singleton or an instance:</p>
<pre>public virtual T Get&lt;T&gt;(Action&lt;T&gt; initializer = null)
  where T : IService
{
  IService instance = null;
  VerifyRegistered&lt;T&gt;();
  Type interfaceType = typeof(T);

  switch (constructionOption[interfaceType])
  {
    case ConstructionOption.AlwaysInstance:
    instance = CreateInstance&lt;T&gt;(initializer);
    instance.Initialize(this);
    break;

    case ConstructionOption.AlwaysSingleton:
    instance = CreateOrGetSingleton&lt;T&gt;(initializer);
    break;

    default:
      throw new ApplicationException(&quot;Cannot determine whether the service &quot; + GetName&lt;T&gt;() + &quot; should be created as a unique instance or as a singleton.&quot;);
  }

  return (T)instance;
}</pre>
<h3>Getting an Instance or a Singleton, Depending on Application Requirements</h3>
<p>If we didn't register the service ahead of time as a singleton or instance 
service, we have to explicitly state what type of instance we want by calling 
either of these methods:</p>
<pre>/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// If allowed, returns a new instance of the service implement interface T.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
public virtual T GetInstance&lt;T&gt;(Action&lt;T&gt; initializer = null)
  where T : IService
{
  VerifyRegistered&lt;T&gt;();
  VerifyInstanceOption&lt;T&gt;();
  IService instance = CreateInstance&lt;T&gt;(initializer);
  instance.Initialize(this);

  return (T)instance;
}

/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// If allowed, creates and registers or returns an existing service that implements interface T.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
public virtual T GetSingleton&lt;T&gt;(Action&lt;T&gt; initializer = null)
  where T : IService
{
  VerifyRegistered&lt;T&gt;();
  VerifySingletonOption&lt;T&gt;();
  IService instance = CreateOrGetSingleton&lt;T&gt;(initializer);

  return (T)instance;
}</pre>
<p>This mechanism allows us to acquire either a singleton or an instance, as the 
application requires.&nbsp; The Service Manager allows us to have a singleton as 
well as multiple instances, but this is an unusual case, and typically we 
specify the intended usage at registration so that the Service Manager can 
assert that the application is using the service as intended.</p>
<h3>Exclusive Services</h3>
<p>Even if a service implements a concrete interface derived from the abstract 
interface, the &quot;magic&quot; of being able to use the abstract interface is 
handled by walking the interface hierarchy and registering all interfaces in the 
hierarchy.</p>
<pre>/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Singletons are allowed to also register their base type so that applications can reference singleton services by the common type
/// rather than their instance specific interface type.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
protected virtual void RegisterSingletonBaseInterfaces(Type interfaceType, Type serviceType)
{
  Type[] itypes = interfaceType.GetInterfaces();

  foreach (Type itype in itypes)
  {
    interfaceServiceMap[itype] = serviceType;
    constructionOption[itype] = ConstructionOption.AlwaysSingleton;
  }
}</pre>
<p>This is a bit dangerous because no assertion is made that there is one and 
only one generic interface associated with the exclusive service.&nbsp; To do 
this, we might resort to using an attribute on the generic interface to indicate 
that any derived concrete interfaces are exclusive, but I haven't implemented 
that.</p>
<h3>IService</h3>
<p>All services must be derived from <code>IService</code>, which provides compile-time 
validation that the service is being registered and instances of the service are 
acquired correctly.&nbsp; </p>
<pre>namespace Clifton.Core.ServiceManagement
{
  public interface IService
  {
    IServiceManager ServiceManager { get; }
    void Initialize(IServiceManager srvMgr);
    void FinishedInitialization();
  }
}</pre>
<p>A service must either implement the <code>ServiceManager</code> property and the two 
methods above, or derive from <code>ServiceBase</code> which provides a default 
implementation:</p>
<pre>namespace Clifton.Core.ServiceManagement
{
  /// &lt;summary&gt;
  /// A useful base class for a default implementation of IService methods.
  /// &lt;/summary&gt;
  public abstract class ServiceBase : IService
  {
    public IServiceManager ServiceManager { get; set; }

    public virtual void Initialize(IServiceManager svcMgr)
    {
      ServiceManager = svcMgr;
    }

    public virtual void FinishedInitialization()
    {
    }
  }
}</pre>
<p>Why is this necessary or useful, especially since the Service Manager itself 
never calls these methods?</p>
<ol>
	<li>In my approach, a service is typically used in conjunction with the Module 
	Manager discussed in the previous article.&nbsp; Services are implemented as 
	modules, and a module can implement (though not usually) more than one 
	service.&nbsp; Therefore, it needs the ability to register services, which 
	requires an instance of the Service Manager.</li>
	<li>Services cannot be used until all the services have been registered.&nbsp; 
	This is somewhat different from a dependency injection framework (DIF), 
	where all the services are injected before the application &quot;runs.&quot;&nbsp; 
	Because my intention is to avoid the additional complexity and often the 
	debugging difficulty of a DIF, I prefer a more &quot;to the metal&quot; approach.&nbsp; 
	This means that registration is a two step process:<ol>
		<li>Initialize the Service Manager instance in each module, allowing the 
		modules to register their services.</li>
		<li>Calling <code>FinishedInitialization</code>, which tells the module that all 
		services have been registered, and it can now do any final 
		initialization with services on which it depends.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
<p>We will see in the next article how the Module Manager and Service Manager 
work together.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Using a service manager is one of those essential tools in the 
programmer's toolbox for implementing the dependency inversion principle.&nbsp; 
Applications implemented using a service manager are well on their way toward 
adhering to the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)">SOLID</a> 
principles of object oriented programming:</p>
<ul>
	<li><i>Single responsibility principle: a class should have only a single 
	responsibility (i.e. only one potential change in the software's 
	specification should be able to affect the specification of the class)</i></li>
	<li><i>Open/closed principle: “software entities … should be open for 
	extension, but closed for modification.”</i></li>
	<li><i>Liskov substitution principle: “objects in a program should be 
	replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the 
	correctness of that program.”</i></li>
	<li><i>Interface segregation principle:&nbsp; “many client-specific 
	interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.”</i></li>
	<li><i>Dependency inversion principle: one should “Depend upon Abstractions. 
	Do not depend upon concretions.”</i></li>
</ul>
<p>The Service Manager presented here begins to create a firm footing in the 
last three principles (L, I, and D.)&nbsp; Using the code presented here and its 
use of generic parameters, or a similar implementation of your own can provide 
compile-time type checking while decoupling concrete implementations, resulting 
in a flexible application exhibiting good independence of both high level and 
low level objects.</p>
